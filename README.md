# LifePilot 🚀

**Preventing Missed Deadlines through Proactive AI Intervention**

Traditional productivity tools and to-do lists are entirely passive—they rely on the user's discipline to check them, prioritize them, and start working. This often leads to procrastination, overwhelming backlogs, and ultimately, missed deadlines. 

LifePilot is an AI-powered productivity companion that shifts task management from passive tracking to active intervention, anticipating risks and helping you execute before time runs out.

## 🎯 Problem It Solves
LifePilot solves the core issue with traditional productivity apps: they are entirely passive. While other tools wait for you to check them, LifePilot actively monitors your deadlines, task complexity, and real-world calendar availability. When it detects a high risk of a missed deadline, it proactively steps in. It solves procrastination and "blank canvas" paralysis by instantly breaking overwhelming tasks into actionable micro-steps, adjusting your schedule dynamically, and offering a real-time interactive voice coach to guide you through roadblocks before time runs out.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges was accurately calculating the "Risk Score" for upcoming deadlines while factoring in the user's actual calendar availability, rather than just raw time until the due date. Integrating the Google Calendar API securely and matching it with Gemini's task decomposition required careful prompt engineering to ensure the AI generated structured, realistic micro-actions that fit into actual free time blocks. Additionally, implementing the real-time Voice Coach using the Deepgram API and Web MediaRecorder within a React environment posed challenges with state management and audio stream handling, which we overcame by building custom React hooks to seamlessly handle the transcription and Gemini API handoffs.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Visual Risk Dashboard (In-App Triage)
Instead of relying on push notifications that are often ignored, the application continuously evaluates task deadlines and presents the most critical work in a dedicated risk dashboard.
* Automatically identifies **"At Risk"** and **"Needs Attention"** tasks.
* Prioritizes tasks based on urgency and deadline risk.
* Gives users a clear visual overview of what requires immediate attention.
* Encourages action before deadlines are missed.

### 2. One-Click AI Task Breakdown
When a task feels overwhelming, the AI transforms it into a structured, actionable plan with a single click.
* Analyzes the selected task and its overall objective.
* Breaks complex work into clear, sequential micro-actions.
* Reduces the mental effort required to get started.
* Provides a practical roadmap that helps users maintain momentum.

### 3. Context-Aware Scheduling (Google Calendar Integration)
Integrates with Google Calendar to understand your real-world availability and plan work more effectively.
* Securely synchronizes the user's calendar events.
* Identifies available time slots between existing commitments.
* Recommends realistic work sessions based on actual availability.
* Helps reduce scheduling conflicts and the risk of missed deadlines.

### 4. On-Demand Voice Accountability Coach
Users can start a real-time voice conversation with the AI whenever they feel stuck, overwhelmed, or distracted.
* Provides conversational guidance during challenging tasks.
* Helps users work through roadblocks and regain focus.
* Acts as an accountability partner throughout the work session.
* Encourages steady progress toward task completion.
